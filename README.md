Analysis on Egg Production Business and Sales in San Jose, Batangas, Philippines

# Introduction
Batangas has a total of 32 municipalities and two key cities and is divided into four
congressional districts. San Jose belongs to the fourth congressional district, which is
designated as the agribusiness area of the province. Established on April 26, 1765 as the old San
Jose de Malaquing Tubig, the fertile soil of San Jose is good for planting coffee, lanzones and
black pepper. As a third class municipality, San Jose has experienced major shift in its
agricultural patterns over the years.

At present, San Jose is known mainly for its robust livestock, poultry and egg industry. What
started as primarily backyard enterprise, the egg production business in this town has now
evolved into commercial scale proportion. The proximity of San Jose to Batangas City, Lipa City
and to the Metro Manila areas ensure the municipality of commercial linkages. As a matter of
fact, the municipality is dubbed as the Egg Basket of the Philippines, generating an estimated
five (5) million eggs daily (Office of Municipal Agriculturist, San Jose).

Entrepreneurs have the awareness of past, current and future issues affecting their future
business enterprise (Laguador, 2013). Premised on this socio-economic milieu and as a
potential resident- entrepreneur, the researcher was inspired to examine the commercial
potentiality of the local egg industry in San Jose, Batangas within a span of three (3) years, from
2018 to 2020, and determine the challenges or problems that have confronted said industry
over the same period.

The outcome of this study will be useful for local egg producers and agricultural land owners
not only in the Municipality of San Jose, but also for the Province of Batangas in order to
determine whether egg production is a better alternative than crop production (black pepper,
coffee and lanzones). This study will also aid also aid the farmers’ organizations like
cooperatives and corporations, feed-milling entities and local government officials in funneling
financial assistance focused on the improvement and expansion of agri-business in the
Province.
