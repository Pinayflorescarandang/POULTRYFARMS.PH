Analysis on Egg Production Business and Sales in Philippines
## Abstract
This research looked into the business and sales of eggs in Philippines. This research focused on the egg industry's success over the last three years (2019-2021) in terms of egg production, and annual gross sales. And the challenges it faces. They were the ones who helped to provide the information needed for this study: Philippine Statistical Authority(PSA). Poultry in Philippines is profitable and known to have the most production here and will continue to grow over the next five years. Some of the challenges poultry owners face are rising feed prices, changing weather and causing illness in chickens, and the advent of covid -19, which has caused a weakening of businesses in the regions, or other provinces.
## Introduction
Eggs are the most environmentally friendly source of animal protein. The chicken egg has become a basic component of every Filipino family's table as a food item. The egg is one that helps our people to have a livelihood such as poultry, cafeteria/ restaurant, and used ingredients for various products. 

According to Agriculture Secretary William Dar, He highlighted the crucial role of the poultry sector in the growth of the agriculture sector during his opening address for the “Philippine Poultry and Livestock Virtual Summit” on August 27, 2021.
Poultry production accounts for 13% of agriculture gross value added (GVA). He said "we aim to help farm families recover from the loss of jobs and unemployment due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and those whose poultry stocks were depleted by avian influenza.”

The findings of this research will be valuable to local egg producers and agricultural landowners, not only in San Jose but also in Batangas Province, in determining whether egg production is a better alternative to crop cultivation (black pepper, coffee, and lanzones). This research will also assist farmers' groups such as cooperatives and businesses, feed-milling companies, and local government authorities in channeling financial assistance aimed at improving and expanding agribusiness in the province.

## Statement of the Problem
According to our research and interviews, the poultry industry is difficult to work in, with respondents citing disease outbreaks, changing weather, bacteria/bird flu, and chicken manure as issues, as well as feed costs and understaffing. Furthermore, they stated that the issue in egg production is oversupply, marketing, soft and shell breaks, and premature chicken development. Due to the difficult availability of egg transactions across the country, there was a restriction on the release of egg products in the country, but this poultry business is gradually rising and developing. When it comes to the price of eggs, many people are concerned because it is gradually rising.

We all know that we have the egg producers here in the Philippines, but we've known that there's a challenge or problems we encountered in selling eggs. Just like those who are starting a business.

There's so many platforms we use to sell the eggs like online platforms, and also a fliers. We've encountered so many problems in the chicken like flue or viruses that the chicken facing. So that we have to protect the chicken so that their eggs is good and not rotten.

As for the average farmgate price of chicken eggs by 2018 - 2020, the annual amount in 2018 from January to December is 53,356, in 2019 the annual amount from January to December is 63,532, and lastly the 2020 annual amount is 74,156.This source is from The Agricultural Accounts Division, Philippine Statistics Authority (DDA , PSA)
