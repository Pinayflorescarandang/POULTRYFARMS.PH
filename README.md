SANJOSEPOULTRYFARMS.PH - Analysis on Egg Production Business in San Jose, 
Batangas, Philippines

# Introduction
Batangas has a total of 32 municipalities and two key cities and is divided into four
congressional districts. San Jose belongs to the fourth congressional district, which is
designated as the agribusiness area of the province. Established on April 26, 1765 as the old San
Jose de Malaquing Tubig, the fertile soil of San Jose is good for planting coffee, lanzones and
black pepper. As a third class municipality, San Jose has experienced major shift in its
agricultural patterns over the years.

At present, San Jose is known mainly for its robust livestock, poultry and egg industry. What
started as primarily backyard enterprise, the egg production business in this town has now
evolved into commercial scale proportion. The proximity of San Jose to Batangas City, Lipa City

fact, the municipality is dubbed as the Egg Basket of the Philippines, generating an estimated
five (5) million eggs daily (Office of Municipal Agriculturist, San Jose).
